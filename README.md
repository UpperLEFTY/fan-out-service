# Fan-Out Service with Node.js, Express, and Redis

This project implements a fan-out service using Node.js, Express, and Axios for making HTTP requests, along with Redis for distributed caching to optimize performance.

## Features

- **Distributed Caching**: Uses Redis to cache results of expensive operations to avoid redundant processing.
- **Batch Processing**: Combines multiple requests into a single batch if downstream services support batch processing.
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes multiple requests in parallel to improve efficiency.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate error responses.
- **Logging**: Logs important events and errors to help with debugging and monitoring.
